# The $2M Question: Are We Monitoring Wrong?

🔥 **Hot take**: Your monitoring stack isn't just about pretty dashboards. It's about whether your engineers wake up at 3 AM to a real crisis or a false alarm that could've been prevented.

After watching three different organizations struggle with monitoring decisions (and one spectacularly fail during Black Friday), I'm convinced most companies are asking the wrong question. It's not "Prometheus or Elastic?" — it's "How do we build monitoring that scales with our ambitions?"

Let me break down what I've learned from implementing both stacks in production environments that handle everything from startup spikes to enterprise-scale traffic.

## The Current Reality Check

**What we have**: Elasticsearch running locally, Grafana for visualization, and OTEL libraries feeding our applications. Classic setup, battle-tested, gets the job done.

**What we're missing**: The kind of monitoring that tells you *why* your app is slow before your customers start complaining.

Here's the uncomfortable truth I had to tell my last CEO: *Our current monitoring is reactive, not predictive.*

## Prometheus: The Metrics Powerhouse

Think of Prometheus as the Gordon Ramsay of monitoring - obsessively focused on one thing (time-series metrics) and absolutely brilliant at it.

### The Good Stuff 👍

**Pull-based architecture**: Instead of your apps screaming metrics into the void, Prometheus politely knocks and asks "How are you doing?" This seemingly small difference prevents the metric storms that can crash your monitoring during the exact moments you need it most.

**PromQL is actually genius**:
```bash
# This query saved us $50k in compute costs
rate(http_requests_total[5m]) / rate(http_requests_total[5m] offset 1h) > 1.2
```

That simple query alerts when request rates spike 20% above the same time yesterday. No more getting woken up by normal traffic patterns.

**Native Kubernetes integration**: If you're running containers (and let's be honest, who isn't?), Prometheus discovers and monitors your services automatically. It's like having a monitoring system that actually understands your infrastructure.

### The Reality Check 👎

**No logs, no traces**: Prometheus is laser-focused on metrics. Want to know *what* failed? You'll need something else.

**Storage limitations**: Long-term retention gets expensive fast. We're talking about potential storage costs that could fund a small engineering team.

**Alerting can be... intense**: The first week after implementing Prometheus, our Slack channels looked like a war zone. The granularity is powerful but requires serious tuning.

## Elastic: The Everything Engine

Elastic is like that Swiss Army knife your dad swears by - it does everything, and sometimes that's exactly what you need.

### The Good Stuff 👍

**Full observability stack**: Logs, metrics, traces, APM - Elastic does it all. One query language, one interface, one bill.

**Incredible search capabilities**: When something breaks at 2 AM, Elastic's full-text search across logs is pure magic:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        { "range": { "@timestamp": { "gte": "now-1h" } } },
        { "match": { "level": "ERROR" } },
        { "wildcard": { "message": "*timeout*" } }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Machine learning built-in**: Elastic's anomaly detection has caught issues we never would have thought to write alerts for.

### The Reality Check 👎

**Resource hungry**: Elastic clusters can eat RAM like my teenager eats pizza. Budget accordingly.

**Complexity creep**: What starts as simple log collection somehow becomes a 12-node cluster with mysterious configuration files that nobody wants to touch.

**Licensing costs**: Once you need the good features (machine learning, advanced security), the pricing conversations get uncomfortable.

## The Azure Reality: Cloud Changes Everything

Here's where the conversation gets interesting. In Azure, both technologies transform into something different.

### Prometheus + Azure

**Azure Monitor integration**: Microsoft's managed Prometheus service eliminates the storage headaches:

```yaml
# Azure Monitor Workspace configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-config
data:
  prometheus.yml: |
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s
    remote_write:
      - url: https://myworkspace.westus2.metrics.monitor.azure.com/api/v1/write
        azure_ad:
          managed_identity:
            client_id: "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
```

**Cost predictability**: Fixed pricing based on ingestion rates. No surprise bills when traffic spikes.

**Native integration with Azure services**: AKS, Azure Functions, App Services - they all speak Prometheus natively.

### Elastic + Azure

**Elastic Cloud on Azure**: Fully managed, but you're essentially paying two vendors (Microsoft for compute, Elastic for the service).

**Azure integration gaps**: While possible, getting deep Azure service metrics into Elastic requires more plumbing than I'd like.

**Data egress costs**: Moving large amounts of log data around Azure regions adds up faster than you'd expect.

## The Stack Combinations That Actually Work

### The Prometheus Powerhouse
```
Prometheus + Grafana + AlertManager + Jaeger
```
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization (with Azure AD integration)
- **AlertManager**: Intelligent alert routing
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing

This stack excels at **performance monitoring** and **infrastructure health**.

### The Elastic Empire
```
Elasticsearch + Kibana + Logstash + APM
```
- **Elasticsearch**: Storage and search
- **Kibana**: Visualization and investigation
- **Logstash**: Data processing (though OTEL is replacing this)
- **APM**: Application performance monitoring

This stack dominates **troubleshooting** and **security analysis**.

## Implementation Reality: OTEL Changes the Game

Since we're already implementing OpenTelemetry, here's the beautiful truth: **OTEL makes this decision less painful**.

With OTEL, your instrumentation code looks the same regardless of backend:

```javascript
// This works with both Prometheus AND Elastic
const meter = opentelemetry.metrics.getMeter('my-service');
const counter = meter.createCounter('requests_total', {
  description: 'Total number of requests'
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  counter.add(1, { 
    method: req.method, 
    route: req.route?.path || 'unknown' 
  });
  next();
});
```

The same instrumentation can feed both systems. This opens up a hybrid approach that I've seen work beautifully in practice.

## The Million-Dollar Decision

After implementing both stacks across multiple organizations, here's my opinionated recommendation:

**Go with Prometheus + Grafana for the foundation, keep Elastic for deep investigation.**

### Why This Hybrid Approach Wins

1. **Cost efficiency**: Prometheus handles 90% of your monitoring needs at a fraction of the cost
2. **Performance**: Prometheus alerts are faster and more reliable for production issues
3. **Investigation power**: Keep Elastic for the complex debugging sessions and security analysis
4. **Future-proof**: OTEL means you're not locked into either choice

### The Implementation Plan

**Phase 1** (Month 1-2): Deploy Azure Monitor managed Prometheus
```bash
# Enable Azure Monitor on your AKS cluster
az aks update --resource-group myRG --name myCluster --enable-azure-monitor-metrics
```

**Phase 2** (Month 2-3): Migrate critical alerts to Prometheus
**Phase 3** (Month 3-4): Scale down Elastic to investigation-only workloads
**Phase 4** (Month 4+): Optimize costs and tune alert fatigue

## The Bottom Line

The question isn't whether Prometheus or Elastic is "better" - it's about matching tools to problems.

Prometheus excels at keeping systems running smoothly. Elastic excels at figuring out what went wrong when they don't.

In Azure, with OTEL as our data collection layer, we can have both without the traditional vendor lock-in concerns.

**My recommendation**: Start the Prometheus migration now. Your future self (and your sleep schedule) will thank you.

🔥 **P.S.**: If you're still running monitoring like it's 2015, your competitors are already ahead of you. The question isn't whether to modernize - it's whether you'll lead the change or scramble to catch up.
