I'm a Cloud DevOps Engineer living in DE Aachen. I always want to know how software works (developing), the lifecycle of the application (deploying and monitoring) to create beautiful software that delights users. I learn some new things in my free time so that i could stay ahead of the game and maybe challenge the state of the art someday. I contribute to open source projects too sometimes.

I'm currently on the DevOps team at Klafka und Hinz where I focus on building  the platform for the developers, the application that manage the lifecycle of applications, the software for automated testing, the migration and the cloud infrastructure of the application, and monitoring functionality. After hours, I'm exploring new ideas and technologies, sometimes building an apps that maybe could help someone out there.
