# Prometheus vs Elastic: Strategic Monitoring Decision for Our ASP.NET Core Infrastructure

## Executive Summary

As we evaluate our monitoring strategy, the fundamental question isn't just "which technology is better," but rather "which approach aligns with our C#/.NET ecosystem while optimizing both operational efficiency and costs across on-premise and Azure cloud environments."

After comprehensive analysis of both scenarios, I'm presenting this technical evaluation to address the core concerns around resource utilization, maintenance overhead, and strategic technology alignment.

## Current State Assessment

**Our Environment Context:**
- Internal tools and applications (non-SaaS)
- Currently Windows hosting (Linux migration planned for this year)
- Moderate request volume: ~10,000-50,000 requests/day
- Small to medium-scale monitoring requirements

**Our Existing Stack:**
- Elasticsearch cluster (local deployment)
- Elastic APM for application performance monitoring
- Grafana for visualization and dashboards
- OpenTelemetry for instrumentation across C# applications

**Pain Points:**
- Elasticsearch cluster requires 8-16GB RAM minimum even for our modest load
- Weekly maintenance overhead: 2-4 hours (cluster health monitoring, updates, backups)
- **ASP.NET Core dashboard availability**: 
  - Limited pre-built Grafana dashboards specifically for ASP.NET Core applications with Elastic data source
  - Most [Elastic Grafana dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/?search=elastic) target infrastructure monitoring (Beats, Metricbeat) rather than application metrics
  - Microsoft provides official ASP.NET Core dashboards optimized for Prometheus format
  - Custom dashboard development needed for ASP.NET Core + Elastic combination
  - *([Technical details on format differences](./opentelemetry-architecture-dashboard-compatibility))*
- Setup complexity for Windows-hosted applications (applies to both solutions)
- Manual cluster scaling vs single-node vertical scaling

## Scenario 1: On-Premise Environment Analysis

### Elastic Stack (Current Approach)

**Infrastructure Requirements (internal tools):**
```bash
# Minimal viable Elastic cluster for our 10k-50k requests/day
- Single Elasticsearch node: 1x (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM)
- APM Server: 1x (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
- Grafana: 1x (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
# Total: 12GB RAM, 8 vCPUs for monitoring infrastructure
# Note: This is minimum viable - production typically needs 16-24GB RAM
```

**Advantages:**
- Complete control over data locality and security
- Full feature set without licensing restrictions
- Established expertise within the team
- Unified logging and metrics platform

**Challenges:**
- High resource consumption for monitoring infrastructure
- **Complex cluster scaling**: When traffic increases, requires:
  - Adding new Elasticsearch nodes to the cluster
  - Rebalancing shards across nodes
  - Configuring cluster discovery settings
  - Managing node coordination and master election
  - Monitoring cluster health during scaling operations
- **Manual scaling process**: No automatic horizontal scaling for on-premise deployments

### Prometheus Stack (Alternative Approach)

**Infrastructure Requirements (internal tools):**
```bash
# Prometheus deployment for 10k-50k requests/day
- Prometheus server: 1x (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) = 4GB RAM
- AlertManager: 1x (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM) = 1GB RAM  
- Grafana: 1x (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM) = 2GB RAM
# Total: 7GB RAM, 5 vCPUs for monitoring infrastructure
# Windows compatible: All components run natively on Windows Server
```

**Advantages:**
- 42% reduction in resource requirements
- Native ASP.NET Core metrics support
- Pre-built Microsoft dashboards available
- **Simplified scaling**: For small-medium loads:
  - Single-node deployment (no cluster complexity)
  - Vertical scaling: add more CPU/RAM to existing server
  - Horizontal scaling via federation (for larger deployments)
  - No shard rebalancing or cluster coordination needed

**Implementation with ASP.NET Core:**

*Required NuGet packages:*
```xml
<PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting" Version="1.6.0" />
<PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore" Version="1.6.0-beta.2" />
<PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Prometheus.AspNetCore" Version="1.6.0-rc.1" />
```

```csharp
// Program.cs - Official Microsoft OpenTelemetry configuration
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
  .WithMetrics(metrics =>
  {
    // Built-in ASP.NET Core metrics
    metrics
      .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
      .AddHttpClientInstrumentation()
      .AddRuntimeInstrumentation()
      .AddPrometheusExporter();
  });

var app = builder.Build();

// Expose metrics endpoint for Prometheus scraping
app.MapPrometheusScrapingEndpoint("/metrics");

app.Run();
```

*Source: [ASP.NET Core metrics - Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/log-mon/metrics/metrics?view=aspnetcore-9.0)*

**Custom Business Metrics (OpenTelemetry.NET):**
```csharp
public class OrderProcessingService
{
  private readonly Counter<int> _processedOrders;
  private readonly Histogram<double> _processingDuration;

  public OrderProcessingService(IMeterFactory meterFactory)
  {
    var meter = meterFactory.Create("MyApp.Orders");
    _processedOrders = meter.CreateCounter<int>("orders_processed_total", 
      description: "Total processed orders");
    _processingDuration = meter.CreateHistogram<double>("order_processing_duration_seconds", 
      description: "Order processing time in seconds");
  }

  public async Task<ProcessResult> ProcessOrderAsync(Order order)
  {
    var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
    try
    {
      var result = await ExecuteProcessingAsync(order);
      _processedOrders.Add(1, 
        new KeyValuePair<string, object?>("status", "success"),
        new KeyValuePair<string, object?>("payment_type", order.PaymentType));
      return result;
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
      _processedOrders.Add(1, 
        new KeyValuePair<string, object?>("status", "failed"),
        new KeyValuePair<string, object?>("payment_type", order.PaymentType));
      throw;
    }
    finally
    {
      _processingDuration.Record(stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds,
        new KeyValuePair<string, object?>("payment_type", order.PaymentType));
    }
  }
}

// Register in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddSingleton<OrderProcessingService>();
```

*Source: [ASP.NET Core metrics - Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/log-mon/metrics/metrics?view=aspnetcore-9.0)*

**Ready-Made Dashboard Integration:**
Microsoft provides official ASP.NET Core Grafana dashboards ([aspnetcore-grafana](https://github.com/JamesNK/aspnetcore-grafana)) that include:
*Note: Dashboard source code is now maintained at [aka.ms/dotnet/grafana-source](https://aka.ms/dotnet/grafana-source)*
- HTTP request duration and throughput metrics
- Exception rates with detailed breakdowns
- GC performance and memory utilization
- Database connection pool monitoring
- Custom business metrics visualization

**Time Savings:** These dashboards eliminate 20-40 hours of manual dashboard creation.

### API Comparison: Implementation Similarities

**Both approaches use nearly identical OpenTelemetry configuration:**

```csharp
// Common OpenTelemetry setup for both Prometheus and Elastic
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
  .WithMetrics(metrics => metrics
    .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
    .AddHttpClientInstrumentation()
    .AddRuntimeInstrumentation()
    // The only difference is the exporter:
    .AddPrometheusExporter()     // For Prometheus
    .AddOtlpExporter()           // For Elastic APM Server
  );
```

**Alternative: Elastic APM Agent (even simpler):**
```csharp
// Elastic APM Agent - single line setup
builder.Services.AddAllElasticApm();
```

**The instrumentation and metrics collection are identical** - the main difference is the export destination, not the implementation complexity.

### On-Premise Cost Comparison (3-Year Analysis)

```bicep
resource prometheusWorkspace 'Microsoft.Monitor/accounts@2025-05-03-preview' = {
  name: 'prometheus-workspace-prod'
  location: location
  properties: {
    publicNetworkAccess: 'Enabled'
  }
}

resource aksCluster 'Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters@2023-07-01' = {
  name: 'aks-cluster-prod'
  location: location
  properties: {
    azureMonitorProfile: {
      metrics: {
        enabled: true
        kubeStateMetrics: {
          metricLabelsAllowlist: ''
          metricAnnotationsAllowList: ''
        }
      }
    }
    addonProfiles: {
      azureMonitorMetrics: {
        enabled: true
        config: {
          prometheusWorkspaceResourceId: prometheusWorkspace.id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Azure CLI Deployment:**
```bash
# Single command to enable managed Prometheus
az aks update \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --enable-azure-monitor-metrics \
    --prometheus-workspace-resource-id /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Monitor/accounts/{workspace}

## Microsoft Ecosystem Integration Analysis

### ASP.NET Core Native Metrics

Microsoft's official documentation ([ASP.NET Core Metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/log-mon/metrics/metrics?view=aspnetcore-9.0)) specifically recommends Prometheus with OpenTelemetry:

```csharp
// Built-in metrics available automatically:
// - http.server.request.duration
// - http.server.active_requests  
// - aspnetcore.routing.match_attempts
// - aspnetcore.diagnostics.exceptions
// - aspnetcore.rate_limiting.requests

// Enhanced metrics with custom context
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    var feature = context.Features.Get<IHttpMetricsTagsFeature>();
    if (feature != null)
    {
        // Add business context to metrics
        feature.Tags.Add("tenant_id", context.Request.Headers["X-Tenant-ID"]);
        feature.Tags.Add("api_version", context.Request.Headers["X-API-Version"]);
        feature.Tags.Add("feature_flag", GetFeatureContext(context));
    }
    await next();
});
```

### Performance Comparison

*Note: Performance metrics are estimates based on typical deployment scenarios and may vary based on configuration, load, and infrastructure.*

| Metric | Elastic (Current) | Prometheus + Azure |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Metric ingestion latency | 30-60 seconds* | 5-15 seconds* |
| Query response time | 2-5 seconds* | 100-500ms* |
| Dashboard load time | 5-15 seconds* | 1-3 seconds* |
| Alert evaluation frequency | 1 minute | 15 seconds |
| Data retention cost | High (full indexing) | Low (time-series compression) |

*\*Performance varies by data volume, query complexity, and infrastructure configuration*

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Migration Risks (Manageable)

**Technical Risk: Data Continuity**
- *Mitigation*: Run both systems in parallel during transition
- *Timeline*: 2-3 month overlap period

**Operational Risk: Team Learning Curve**
- *Mitigation*: Existing Grafana knowledge transfers directly
- *Training Required*: 1-2 weeks for PromQL basics

**Business Risk: Service Disruption** 
- *Mitigation*: Gradual migration with rollback capability
- *Fallback Plan*: Maintain Elastic for critical services during transition

### Staying with Current Stack Risks (High Impact)

**Financial Risk: Escalating Costs**
- Resource requirements grow exponentially with data volume
- Maintenance overhead increases with cluster complexity

**Technical Risk: Microsoft Ecosystem Misalignment**
- Missing native ASP.NET Core optimizations
- Increasing integration complexity with Azure services
- Technical debt accumulation

**Strategic Risk: Competitive Disadvantage**
- Slower time-to-market for new monitoring capabilities
- Reduced operational efficiency compared to cloud-native approaches

## Linux Migration Strategic Advantage

**Current Challenge: Windows Hosting**
Our applications currently run on Windows, but the planned Linux migration this year presents an opportunity to optimize our monitoring strategy.

**Prometheus Advantage During Migration:**

*(See [Appendix B](#appendix-b) for a full cost analysis of running the monitoring stacks on Linux.)*
- Identical configuration and behavior across Windows and Linux
- No licensing concerns when moving from Windows Server
- Container-ready architecture aligns with modern deployment practices
- Simplified infrastructure management post-migration

**Cost Impact of Migration (Germany/EU):**
```
Windows Server Licensing Elimination:
- Current: €960-1,440/year for monitoring VMs
- Future: €0/year with Linux containers
- Additional savings: €2,880-4,320 over 3 years
```

## Recommendation

After comprehensive analysis, I'm making scenario-specific recommendations based on our internal tools environment:

### Scenario 1: On-Premise Environment

**Prometheus with Grafana**

**Why Prometheus Wins On-Premise:**
1. **Resource Efficiency**: 42% less RAM usage (7GB vs 12GB)
2. **Cost Savings**: €3,435 savings over 3 years (10% reduction on Windows)
3. **Lower Data Volume**: Smaller storage and backup requirements
4. **Cross-Platform**: Runs natively on Windows and Linux
5. **Ready-Made Dashboards**: Microsoft's ASP.NET Core dashboards available out-of-the-box

**Implementation Advantage**: With our planned Linux migration, Prometheus provides identical functionality across both platforms, eliminating future reconfiguration work.

### Scenario 2: Azure Cloud Environment

**Prometheus with Azure Monitor**

**Why Prometheus Wins in Azure:**
1. **Native Integration**: Zero-configuration Azure Monitor managed service
2. **Cost Efficiency**: €16,533 savings over 3 years (49% cost reduction)
3. **Operational Excellence**: Zero maintenance overhead with managed service
4. **Microsoft Ecosystem**: Aligns with documented ASP.NET Core best practices
5. **Enterprise Features**: Built-in HA, backup, and security compliance

**Strategic Advantage**: Azure Monitor Prometheus eliminates infrastructure management entirely while providing enterprise-grade reliability.

### Hybrid Strategy: Best of Both Worlds

**Primary Monitoring: Prometheus with Grafana**
- Real-time metrics and alerting
- Application performance monitoring
- Infrastructure health dashboards
- Business metrics visualization

**Secondary Capability: Retain Elastic (Scaled Down)**
- Log analysis for debugging
- Security event correlation
- Compliance audit trails
- Complex text search when needed

## Final Recommendation

**For both on-premise and cloud environments, Prometheus and Grafana is a better choice for our C#/.NET environment.**

The evidence shows consistent advantages across both scenarios:
- **10% cost reduction on-premise** (€3,435 savings on Windows)
- **Significant operational efficiency gains in cloud** (€16,533 savings - 49% reduction)
- **Native ASP.NET Core integration**
- **Strategic alignment with our Linux migration plans**
- **Microsoft ecosystem compatibility**

---

💡 This isn't just a technology decision—it's a strategic investment that positions us for operational excellence while dramatically reducing costs and maintenance overhead.

**Next Step**: I am happy to share some demo implementation with Prometheus and  Grafana for the firstadmin application.

Total Annual Cost: €8,939
3-Year Total: €26,817
`}`

**Linux Deployment Savings: €5,235 over 3 years (16% cost reduction)**

### Appendix C: Backup Cost Analysis

**The backup cost difference is driven by data volume, not operational complexity:**

**Elasticsearch Backup Requirements:**
- **Data Volume**: ~200-300GB (logs + metrics + indices)
- **Backup Storage**: ~300GB (with compression)

**Prometheus Backup Requirements:**
- **Data Volume**: ~50-75GB (compressed time-series)
- **Backup Storage**: ~75GB

**Key Insight**: Both systems use the same backup infrastructure and processes. The cost difference is purely storage-based.

### Key Insight

The primary cost driver remains **operational activities** (maintenance, upgrades, patches), not licensing. Linux eliminates the Windows Server licensing component entirely, providing additional savings for organizations planning infrastructure migrations.
