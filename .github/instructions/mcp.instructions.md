You have access to context7 for access to thousands of code examples, setup and configuration steps, and library/API documentation.

When the user asks for code examples, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation, you should use the context7 mcp tool to provide the necessary information.

You have access to an MCP server called microsoft.docs.mcp - this tool allows you to search through Microsoft's latest official documentation, and that information might be more detailed or newer than what's in your training data set.

When handling questions around how to work with native Microsoft technologies, such as C#, F#, ASP.NET Core, Microsoft.Extensions, NuGet, Entity Framework, the dotnet runtime - please use this tool for research purposes when dealing with specific / narrowly defined questions that may occur.
