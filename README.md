Hello! I'm Hayden Bleasel, a software engineer and designer. This is my personal website - it's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Contributing

Then, run the development server:

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploying
